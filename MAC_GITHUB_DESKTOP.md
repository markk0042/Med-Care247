## After Creating the Repository:

### Step 1: Check if Repository is Visible
- You should see "Medcare247" in the left sidebar
- Click on it to select it

### Step 2: Connect to GitHub (Alternative Methods)

**Method A: Publish Repository Button**
- Look at the top toolbar for a button that says:
  - **"Publish repository"** 
  - OR **"Push origin"**
  - OR a button with an up arrow (↑)
- Click it - it may prompt you to set the remote URL

**Method B: Repository Menu**
- Click **"Repository"** in the menu bar (top of screen)
- Look for:
  - **"Repository Settings..."**
  - OR **"Options..."**
  - OR **"Settings..."**
- Click it, then look for **"Remote"** tab

**Method C: Right-Click Method**
- Right-click on "Medcare247" in the left sidebar
- Look for **"Repository Settings"** or **"Options"**

### Step 3: If You See Files Ready to Commit
- In the main window, you should see a list of files on the left
- At the bottom, there should be:
  - A text box for "Summary" (commit message)
  - A button that says **"Commit to main"** or just **"Commit"**
- If you see this, you can commit first, then connect to GitHub

### Step 4: After Committing
- Once you've committed, look for:
  - **"Publish branch"** button (usually appears after first commit)
  - OR **"Push origin"** button
  - OR a button in the top toolbar
