## Verify You're in the Right Folder

Once opened, check the bottom-left of Cursor's window - it should show:
```
Med-Care247
```

Or check the file explorer - you should see:
- ✅ `package.json`
- ✅ `src/` folder
- ✅ `public/` folder (with `policies/` inside)
- ✅ `.git` folder (hidden, but exists)

## Quick Test

After opening, check if `src/pages/Policies.jsx` contains:
- "NQP Policies and Procedures" (around line 21)
- If yes, you're in the right folder! ✅
