   - Set the remote URL to: `https://github.com/markk0042/Medcare247.git`
   - Name: `origin`

5. **Commit Your Files:**
   - All your files should appear in the left panel
   - Write a commit message like: "Initial commit: MedCare247 website with all pages and features"
   - Click "Commit to main" (or "Commit to master")

6. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Click "Publish branch" or "Push origin" button
   - If prompted, authenticate with your GitHub credentials
   - Your code will be pushed to: https://github.com/markk0042/Medcare247.git

## Note:
If you need to authenticate, GitHub Desktop will guide you through the process. You may need to:
- Sign in with your GitHub account
- Or use a Personal Access Token if two-factor authentication is enabled
