# Which Folder Should You Use?

## Important: You Have Two Project Folders

1. **`/Users/markkelly/Documents/medcare247`** (lowercase, no hyphen)
   - ❌ NOT a git repository (no .git folder)
   - This is where you're editing in Cursor
   - Changes won't appear in GitHub Desktop

2. **`/Users/markkelly/Documents/Med-Care247/Med-Care247`** (capital M, C, with hyphen)
   - ✅ IS a git repository (has .git folder)
   - This is connected to GitHub
   - GitHub Desktop watches this folder

## Solution: Use the Correct Folder

**Option 1: Open the Correct Folder in Cursor (Recommended)**
1. Close the current project in Cursor
2. Open: `/Users/markkelly/Documents/Med-Care247/Med-Care247`
3. This is the folder connected to GitHub
4. All changes will appear in GitHub Desktop

**Option 2: Keep Using Current Folder**
- I've copied the updated files to the git repository
- But you'll need to always copy changes manually
- Or switch to the correct folder

## To See Changes in GitHub Desktop:

1. **Open GitHub Desktop**
2. **Click "File" → "Add Local Repository"** (if needed)
3. **Navigate to:** `/Users/markkelly/Documents/Med-Care247/Med-Care247`
4. **Add the repository**
5. You should now see all your changes, including:
   - Policies.jsx (with NQP card)
   - Policies.css (with contact button styles)
   - All other updated files

## Current Status:

✅ **Files Updated:** Policies.jsx and Policies.css now have NQP Policies card
✅ **Files Copied:** Changes copied to git repository folder
✅ **Ready to Commit:** Files are in the correct location for GitHub Desktop

## Next Steps:

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Make sure it's watching: `/Users/markkelly/Documents/Med-Care247/Med-Care247`
3. You should see the changes ready to commit
4. Commit and push!
